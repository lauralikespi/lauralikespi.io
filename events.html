						<img width="25%" height="auto" src="css/img/paddle_logo.png" alt="Paddle Logo"/>
						<p> <strong> Cost: </strong> £65 per kid per day </p>
						<p> includes lunch and snacks </p>
						<p> <strong> Age: </strong> 6-8 (however happy to discuss 5-10) </p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-full">
						<p> The aim of these two days is to start children thinking about technology and logic, and how these can be used for really cool things. </p>

						<p> The course will include games, playing with technology and age appropriate coding activities. We're also very keen to make sure that coding and creativity go hand in hand. </p>

						<p> At the minute Taught by Humans is using all the money raised from these courses to provide courses for children and young adults who can't access such courses (for example, we are running some website development courses for young entrepreneurs in North London and we are hoping to get some Saturday tech clubs running at local libraries next year). </p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-half">
						<br/>
						<p> This day will introduce the children to important concepts in coding (such as rules, sequential order, loops) by playing games and learning Scratch. It’s not only for children who are into gaming, it’s more about patterns and design thinking (so don’t let Game Design put anyone off). </p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-half">
						<br/>
						<p> Chatbots are a great way to get children thinking about concepts such as loops and if statements. Raspberry Pis are amazing! It’s extremely easy, using block based programming in Scratch to make lights turn on and off.</p>

						<p> <strong> What is the idea? </strong> A mentoring scheme aimed at Year 9 children which aims to expose them to a range of careers they might not normally hear of. We want these careers to be STEM careers that use a variety of skills that may not be associated with STEM, including working with people and organisational skills. Examples of these careers are innovation, implementation, service design and science communication. </p>
						<p> <strong> What is the plan?</strong> The pilot will begin in January and last for six months. The aim is for the mentor to assist the mentee in a project over the course of the scheme. This will involve the mentor travelling to the student's school once a month for a two hour session to work together. After six months, we would like to hold a show and tell event where the students can present what they have been working on (hopefully with some prizes from companies in London). We'd love for this to be at a central London office in the afternoon. All our mentors will be registered STEM Ambassadors (which involves DBS checking). </p>
