				<h2> About </h2>

				<p> We’re taught by humans (part of the wider tbh family), and we think education needs some innovation.</p>

				<h3> Human-Centric </h3>

				<p> Well, by human-centric we have our students and teachers (the humans) at the heart of everything we do. All of our teachers are amazing inspiring individuals who bring something special to their teaching. We hope to give our students the best possible education, and make them curious enough to continue learning themselves.</p>

				<p> We love how much information is available on the internet, especially free courses and MOOCs. However, we think education needs a human touch from time to time. That’s where we come in.</p> 

			</div>

			<div class="col-third">
				<h3> Teaching+ </h3>

				<p> <s>“Those who can do, those who can’t teach” </s></p>
				<p> Teaching is a skill, a difficult one to be amazing at. It shouldn’t be a fall back career, it should be those who are passionate about their subject (or just learning, in general), and want to inspire the next generation.</p>

				<p> Being able to explain complex topics, creating exercises and stories to aid their curriculum, and making all this attention-worthy and fun aren’t things everyone can do. </p>

				<p> We don’t have teachers, who just “teach”. We have developers, innovators, designers, roboticists, the list goes on and on, who want to pass on what they’ve learnt to others. (If you are interested in becoming one of our humans, just fill in <span class="link">this form</span>) </p>

			</div>

			<div class="col-third">
				<h3> Time-Travel (sort of) </h3>

				<p> We don’t actually mean we’ve built a time machine. What we do mean, is we want our education to be future proof. The world is changing so rapidly that life-long learning is the new norm. Therefore, future proof learning is about more than just coding and robots (although we love those).</p>

				<p> We not only want to teach the contents of our curriculums - we want to help everyone learn for themselves. </p>

				<p> We also focus on courses that we think will be useful for the future. Therefore, we update our courses and our course offering constantly.</p>
