					<p> We’re <span class="bigger">taught by humans</span> - a social enterprise aiming to make the opportunities and benefits of technology accessible to everyone. We believe the best way to do this is through education and exposure. Our focus is on designing and delivering amazing curriculums and events based around technology, creativity and innovation and how these touch every aspect of modern life. </p>

					<p> In 2019,we worked with over 100 kids through our Holidays Clubs (teaching Python, Scratch and electronics) and our Corporate Work Experiences (teaching about ideas, innovation and building websites) and a number of adults through our Spreadsheets School. </p>

					<p> Our Social Side was focused in Tottenham where we worked with a local high school to run a weekly coding club and a local co-working space (The Trampery Tottenham) to provide holiday clubs for local children and workshops on branding and websites for their young entrepreneurs.</p>
					
					<p> We have lots more to say about education, technology, innovation in our <a href="https://medium.com/@taughtbyhumans" target="_blank"><span class="link bigger">thoughts by humans</span></a> blog. If you'd like some more information, contact us via our Social Medias.

					<p> Happy Learning :)</p>

					<p> Love,</p>

					<p> the Humans (at <span class="bigger"></span>taught by humans</span>) </p>
				
					<p> PS: Please excuse us while our site is under a redesign. We are also on the move from being headquartered in London to being headquartered in Bristol! We'd love to hear from school, companies and parents in the South West as we are keen to get started. Please get in contact via our Social Medias.</p>
